The lex.c program is a lexical analyzer written in C. It reads in a source file and outputs a list of tokens.

The lexical analyzer is responsible for identifying these tokens and categorizing them into different types, such as identifiers, numbers, and special symbols while **ignoring** grammar.

## How to run

To compile:
`gcc lex.c -o lex`

To run:
`./lex input.txt output.txt`

Remove the compiled file after each run:
`rm lex`
